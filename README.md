## Demo Who Stole My Cheese
A competitive maze game for two players.
Both players must search the maze for cheese pieces, collect them, and protect them from being stolen by enemy mice using mouse traps.
The first player to gather the required amount of cheese for that level wins.

# Game Instructions
- At the start of the game, a pop-up window appears showing the required amount of cheese to collect. To begin playing, click “Start Game.”

- Player 1 moves through the maze using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).

- Player 2 moves through the maze using W, A, S, D.

- To collect cheese or mouse traps, players simply need to walk over them.

If neither player manages to collect and protect the required amount of cheese, the game will end with a Game Over.
